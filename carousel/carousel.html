                The bite from a radioactive spider granted Peter Parker amazing arachnid-like powers. After losing his beloved Uncle Ben to a burglar, grief- stricken Peter vowed to use his incredible abilities to protect his city as the Amazing Spider-Man. Peter’s trials taught him an invaluable lesson: with great power, there must also come great responsibility.
