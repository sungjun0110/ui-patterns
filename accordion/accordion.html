                Aragorn is the Heir of Isildur, who was the last man to be High King of Gondor and Arnor. Not only does Aragorn free the Army of the Dead who were cursed by Isildur to remain in Middle-earth until they had fulfilled their oath of coming to his aid, he also unites the kingdoms of Middle-earth when he is finally crowned as High King of Gondor and Arnor at the end of The Return of the King.

                Arwen is the half-elven daughter of Elrond. She is also the lover of Aragorn. When Arwen must make a decision to either become fully elf, thereby gaining immortality, or fully man, making her a mortal being, she decides on mortality over immortality in order to live with her love, Aragorn.

                Frodo is the bearer of the ring throughout The Lord of the Rings. Without him carrying the ring, it might not have ever made it to Mount Doom to be destroyed. Frodo journeys with Sam and Gollum through much of the story. When he reaches Mount Doom, however, Frodo refuses to destroy the ring at the same time that Gollum attacks him. The ring is destroyed when Frodo pushes Gollum, who has the ring in his hands, into the fires of Mount Doom. He is then transported home by the Eagles, and after a few years of living in the Shire, decides to go to the Gray Havens with Bilbo, Gandalf, and the elves.

                Gandalf was a wizard, or Maiar, who became friends with Bilbo in The Hobbit, in turn becoming friends with Frodo. He is responsible for Bilbo giving the ring to Frodo and for sending Frodo and Sam to Rivendell with the ring. In the end of The Fellowship of the Ring, Gandalf and the Fellowship are overtaken by a Balrog in the Mines of Moria. Gandalf sacrifices his life to ensure the Fellowship can leave Moria alive. In The Two Towers, Gandalf is brought back to life after his battle with the Balrog as Gandalf the White. Throughout The Lord of the Rings, Gandalf is constantly using his powers to help repel Sauron’s forces. He is also responsible for sending the Eagles to rescue Frodo and Sam from the crumbling land of Mordor. In the end of The Return of the King, Gandalf is seen boarding a ship to the Gray Havens.
